# BornDigital_Inventory
Builds a static inventory of file systems to create an inventory guide of the contents. 

## To Do:
- Take CSV import instead of reading file system directly. Could use a standard CSV report like something from NARA accession tools or DROID.
- Convert static HTML to Jekyll or Jinja
